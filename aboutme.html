  <h4 style="text-align:center;">Likes</h4>
  
 I likie puppies,reading and seafood. I hate shopping and i've never traveled before. 
 I like doogs and I own a pitbull and i dislike cats because they aggravate my allergies. My family is from the South so we eat alot seafood we hve a whole night dedicate to eating seafood and playing card games, when I was younger i couldn't play the card games so I got stuck with the younger children. I hate shopping because it's aalot of work getting out of your clothes and then putting them on over and over again.
